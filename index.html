            <li><strong> Step 1:  Evaluate the level of politeness:</strong> 
                For each sentence, the annotator must determine the level of politeness of the sentence. For this he/she must answer: 
                <span class="highlight">What do you consider to be the level of politeness of the sentence?</span>
                 
            <li> <strong>Step 2: Filter sentences: </strong> Researchers filter out statements that can be paraphrased as more polite or less polite. </li>
            <li> <strong>Step 3: Paraphrase the sentence </strong> For each sentence, the annotator must  re-write a <span class="highlight"> less polite  </span> version of the sentence and a <span class="highlight">  more polite  </span> version of the sentence. </li>

            <p> For each sentence, the annotator must determine the level of politeness of the sentence. For this he/she must answer: <strong> What do you consider to be the level of politeness of the sentence? </strong> For example:
                <li> <span class="highlight">very impolite </span>: Your performance in the match was bad, you need to train more. </li>  
                <li> <span class="highlight">somewhat impolite</span>: Train more for the next game </li>  
                <li> <span class="highlight">neutral</span>: Hey, you should train more for the next game. </li>  
                <li> <span class="highlight">somewhat polite</span>: I think you should train more for the next game. </li>  
                <li> <span class="highlight">very polite </span>: Sorry to bother you, but I think you should train more for the next game. </li>  
            </p>

            </div>

            <p> Each sentence should be evaluated independently and should be paraphrased as naturally as possible, trying to modify only the level of politeness of the sentence and not the meaning of the sentence.

                    <ul>
                        <li>When paraphrasing, natural language must be used, so the use of emojis, abbreviations or expressions used in informal contexts is permitted. </li>
                        <li>It is possible to add expressions in the first person to include the speaker's opinion even when the original sentence is in the second person. As seen in example 1 and 2 when adding “I think” or “I suggest”.</li>
                        <li>Expressions of gratitude can be included if the context allows it, for example “I appreciate”.</li>
                        <li>Expressions of apology can be included if the context requires it. As seen in example 1 when adding “Sorry to bother you”.</li>
                        <li>It is possible to change the verbal mode of the sentence. As seen in example 3 when changing "Could you send me" to " Can you send me .."</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The use of vulgar language or insults is not permitted. This type of vocabulary falls into the category of hate speech, which is outside the scope of this study.</li>
                        <li> The repeated use of the same strategy should be avoided. For example, adding “Thanks” or “Please” to the end of all sentences.</li>
                        <li> Overly wordy paraphrases that differ greatly from the length of the original example should be avoided. </li>
